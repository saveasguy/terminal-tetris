## Installation
Unfortunately the project is developed for Windows only. The author of it is not Windows-programmer, so there is lack of knowledge and inspiration (toolchain and build systems on the author's Windows PC).

So everything you have to do is to move a single cpp file to your MS Visual Studio and set C++17 standard.

## Running

The easiest way is to click "Run" in your IDE. You will see the opening terminal with something like this:

And that's it!
